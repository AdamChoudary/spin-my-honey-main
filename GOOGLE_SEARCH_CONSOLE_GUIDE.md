# Google Search Console - Manual Indexing Guide

**For:** Hi Honey (hihoney.site)  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Purpose:** Get all pages indexed in Google Search

---

## 🎯 Why Manual Indexing is Needed

Your site is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with React. While we've implemented:

- ✅ Internal links on homepage
- ✅ Static HTML generation for each route
- ✅ Sitemap with all pages
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement
- ✅ Meta tags and canonical URLs

Manual indexing **speeds up** the discovery process significantly!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed"

**Solution:**

- This is normal for new pages
- Continue requesting indexing weekly
- Ensure homepage links to that page (already done ✅)
- Add more quality content to the page

### Issue: "Discovered - Currently Not Indexed"

**Solution:**

- Google found it but hasn't crawled yet
- Request indexing manually
- Be patient (can take 2-4 weeks)

### Issue: "URL is not on Google" Persists

**Checklist:**

1. ✅ Is the page accessible? Visit it in incognito mode
2. ✅ Does robots.txt allow it? Check: `https://hihoney.site/robots.txt`
3. ✅ Is it in sitemap? Check: `https://hihoney.site/sitemap.xml`
4. ✅ Does it have `noindex` tag? (Should only be on /embed and 404)
5. ✅ Is content substantial? (Not just a few words)

### Issue: "Server Error (5xx)"

**Solution:**

- Check if site is accessible
- Verify hosting is active
- Check Netlify/Vercel deployment logs

### Issue: Indexing Quota Exceeded

**Google limits indexing requests:**

- Free quota: ~10-15 requests per day
- If exceeded, wait 24 hours and continue

**Workaround:**

- Do 3-4 URLs per day over a week
- Priority order: Home → About → Blog → Contact → Others
